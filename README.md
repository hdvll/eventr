# eventr

This site was build in Svelte for educational purposes and demos a cart/checkout app. You can add and delete events added to the cart and the corresponding app state will keep track of total price and number of items.

## storage

The app will store all events (items) added to the cart in local storage to mimic how a real site would "remember" your items.
